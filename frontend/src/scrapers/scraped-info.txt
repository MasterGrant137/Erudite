Heard a lot of things through the grapevine<br>Heard the tick-tock of the clock, still I feel fine<br><br>All my hours feel so close<br>To the kiss of morning<br>Though sky's morose<br>And the clouds are mourning<br><br>Take my leather-bound journal to the Lethe<br>All the wayworn souls by that river won't forget me<br><br>Frozen<br>In the bitter blizzard that's called<br>Wisdom<br>Build a brazen movement<br>Then a kingdom<br><br>You lost reverence<br>Because of close proximity<br>Your residence<br>Is in the bowеls of normalcy<br>Sages eaten<br><br>Know I<br>Do keep a pеn in my vicinity<br>Able to knight a willing subject<br>Upon a bended knee<br>
