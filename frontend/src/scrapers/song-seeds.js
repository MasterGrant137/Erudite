[Verse 1]
Conversion, software version 7.0
Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub
Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

[Chorus]
You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder, disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

[Verse 2]
More wood for their fires, loud neighbors
Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck
Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

[Chorus]
You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder, disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

[Outro]
When I became the sun, I shone life into the man's hearts
When I became the sun, I shone life into the man's hearts

You!
Why do they always send the poor?

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Barbarisms by Barbaras with pointed heels
Victorious Victoria’s kneel for brand new spanking deals
Marching forward, hypocritic and hypnotic computers
You depend on our protection, yet you feed us lies from the table cloth

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox, stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil, crying, "Freedom"
Handed to obsoletion, still, you feed us lies from the table cloth

[Chorus: Serj Tankian with Daron Malakian]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine

[Bridge: Daron Malakian]
Blast off, it's party time
And we don't live in a fascist nation
Blast off, it's party time
And where the fuck are you?

[Refrain: Daron Malakian with Serj Tankian]
Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why they always send the poor?

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox, stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil, crying, "Freedom"
Handed to obsoletion, still, you feed us lies from the table cloth

[Chorus: Serj Tankian with Daron Malakian]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sun

[Refrain: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?

[Outro: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
They always send the poor, they always send the poor

We're rolling "Suicide"

[Verse: Serj Tankian]
Wake up (Wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
Hide your scars to fade away the shakeup (Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go, create another fable, you wanted to
Grab a brush and put a little makeup, you wanted to
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup, you wanted to
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table? You wanted to

[Chorus: Serj Tankian with Daron Malakian]
I don't think you trust
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die

[Verse: Serj Tankian]
Ah! Wake up (Wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little makeup (A little bit)
Hide the scars to fade away the (Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go, create another fable, you wanted to
Grab a brush and put a little makeup, you wanted to
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup, you wanted to
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table? You wanted to

[Chorus: Serj Tankian with Daron Malakian]
I don't think you trust
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die

[Bridge: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Father, father, father, father
Father, father, father, father
Father, into your hands I commend my spirit
Father, into your hands
Why have you forsaken me?
In your eyes, forsaken me?
In your thoughts, forsaken me?
In your heart, forsaken me? Oh

[Outro: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Trust in my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
