Walk fast like a hawk flies fast
See the second hand pass;
Do you really not see?
Father Fate is truly crass, yeah
He's the kind of brother that'll interrupt Mass

I'm 5'10" but I got good posture;
I was bred a hunter, not a vulture;
I use all my ken for the culture
For what's another river 'thout the moisture

I must say I'm:
Rigid like I'm Young Modulus
I, shoot I don't miss
I, see target's fate
I, know beast to sate
I, see it's hard for a lot of brothers to relate
Not going for the check, going for the mate

Only so long, you can be a sunflower
Then you gotta bear fruit, or cowеr, it's true;
Only so long, you ensconce in thе tower
Then you gotta cast your locks down in the mire

Short life of movement
Is sweeter
Than long life
Of stagnancy
So I will keep moving
Even if nigh drowning within the sea

Ticky ticky tock goes the clock
Walk fast like a hawk flies fast
See the second hand pass;
Do you really not see?
Father Fate is truly crass, yeah
He's the kind of brother that'll interrupt Mass

I'm 5'10" but I got good posture;
I was bred a hunter, not a vulture;
I use all my ken for the culture
For what's another river 'thout the moisture

Oftentimes I find it hard to mop my own kitchen
'Cause when I look into the glass I don't see my reflection
I see another brother with encumbrance on his back
Like I'm wading in the murky waters awaiting a shark attack

I could sell ice to an eskimo
Making humid raps dripping with the flow
Flying with the crow
On my shoulder;
I'm a climber
Life's a boulder;
I'm a suitcase
You're a folder

I'm a dirigible—
Individual so likely to rise
'Cause he's seminal—
It's almost criminal
Crafting the rhymes that I do
Whilst being so far from ephemeral;
I go straight on red
'Cause through I keep my head
I rather wash up dead
Than write my runes abed;
I'll pick He every single time over lead
And watch where my feet in the snake pit tread

Ticky ticky tock goes the clock
Walk fast like a hawk flies fast
See the second hand pass;
Do you really not see?
Father Fate is truly crass, yeah
He's the kind of brother that'll interrupt Mass

I pick up my pen
So words can get dancing;
I am the poacher
You keep on prancing;
Give you the Maxim
But I guarantee I'm still advancing;
Many a maxim
Making, even though the pen is taxing

I, must—my ken—relay;
Cry, 'cause life's whip does flay;
Why, have I chosen this rough way?
'Cause I get my fix from the truth I say

Heard the tick-tock of the clock, still I feel fine

All my hours feel so close
To the kiss of morning
Though sky's morose
And the clouds are mourning

Take my leather-bound journal to the Lethe
All the wayworn souls by that river won't forget me

Frozen
In the bitter blizzard that's called
Wisdom
Build a brazen movement
Then a kingdom

You lost reverence
Because of close proximity
Your residence
Is in the bowеls of normalcy
Sages eaten

Know I
Do keep a pеn in my vicinity
Able to knight a willing subject
Upon a bended knee

Don't vie
For my vantage point, unpreparedly
'Cause you might be harrowed
By the things your inner eyes will see

Pick a card
Wonder who you'll meet upon the boulevard
Of your dreams
Met the Reaper just the other day
The scenes with themes
Macabre
Are embedded in my very seams
Abracadabra
Create as I speak and I speak as it truly seems

Speak too much truth
Gotta lie low
Hard to spit a rhyme while in Hades with a halo

I feel craft is the lotion to dryness
When you next address me
You may utter words: Your Highness

Frozen
In the bitter blizzard that's called
Wisdom
Build a brazen movement
Then a kingdom

Daddy always said, "Fear the living, not thе dead,"
Mommy always said, "Work less, use your head,"
And every single day
I mold a little clay
And walk a merry way
And I will some day say:
It's my admission
I am the harvest that came to fruition
Smooth despite friction
Bathed in the lake of each sweet benediction
Keeping conviction in spite of confliction
And even my diction's survived liquidation
And even my flesh has survived the sensation
Of arid words and castigation
Of acrid thoughts and rumination;
I've learned to search for lumination
Midst the black and degradation
And if you want and explanation
Here is my delineation:
Every night I close my eyes
I lock my door—
Avoid surprise—
So I may wake to sun partake
And know my life shan't me forsake
I have:
A little more to bake
A little more to break
A little more air for my lungs to in take
A little more blood for the struggle's sake
I'll fight in the now and forget about the wake;
I've sight for the stars
Skin for the scars
Ink for the bars
Grins for the fight
Smiles for the blight
Vision for the night
And love for the right;
Spinning tasty rhymes like a loom in a cake
Ice to the cream, snow to the flake
Size to leviathan, fire to a drake
Runes innate like plates to a quake

Don't say I need a gold chain

Like a mountain
Untamed;
Do say
That I write strange
That I'm deranged
Liking wrong dogs
With the right mange

I keep hungry, as I go;
I keep steaming, midst the snow;
All my brothers and my sisters see my notepad and they know

Falling, deeper
Midst all, the flames;
When hedge, is steeper
More fun, are games

All my poems
Manufactured to be seminal;
Reaper roams
But I do not walk on tippy-toes;
See ten tombs
But I've noticed only nine are full
You say that pall's for me, you fool
Don't you see I am the ghoul

Don't say I need a gold chain
Or a beat change
Imma maintain
Like a mountain
Untamed;
Do say
That I write strange
That I'm deranged
Liking wrong dogs
With the right mange

Even with a mean dog
One can glean so much from fleas on coat;
Given just a rusty cog
You know what truth some poets wrote?

School's an intellectual
Penitentiary
But I'll still unravel spool
And sew with glee

Writing big buck raps in the bathroom
Stalls;
It appalls
Many
When they find out I get up so quickly from my falls

I till
And I sow;
Got my whip
And lasso

Securing the bag, give me the gold;
Breaking the caste, breaking the mold;
Do what you're told, never do fold
Dichotomy, in the belly of philosophy;
Always watch your back when you're honing luminosity
'Cause a lot of people harbor lots of animosity

I can see the world
Through the tip of my pen;
If you put me in the box
I'm like a bull in a pen;
I've been swimming with my hands tied
Searching for ken
And I've been asking all around
Where have you been?

Death, be not, proud
Why swell'st thou?
Imma make my momma proud
Afore you get the chance to wrap me in a shroud

Uncle, I have been chosen;
On ken I'm a barnacle
On wisdom frozen;
Momma, I have been brazen
Amidst those in coma
And those who are craven

Don't say I need a gold chain
Or a beat change
Imma maintain
Like a mountain
Untamed;
Do say
That I write strange
That I'm deranged
Liking wrong dogs
With the right mange

And all throughout my lifetime
I've been running and writing
And sour like a fresh lime

I'm like a puma roaming through the mountain
I go and eat my prey
And then I drink from the fountain
Of knowledge
Not something just gleaned from college
I gulp it down like it's porridge

Call me Goldilocks
I like kinky locks
You can also call me water
I'm a universal solvent
'Cause every time I spit a rhyme
Everything dissolves, yep
Man, it dissociates
Call your associates
I am a fisherman with all the best of baits
I am a mеal which always—the stomach—sates
I am a gym with the bеst equipment and weights

I'm brushin'
Flossin'
Sharpening my teeth
So I
Can chomp
Down on
All I need

Man, you really gotta keep your skin hardened
Ears perked up
Eyes open
Always hopin'
Never chokin'
In the misery
Fighting for your inner glee;
Step to me
This is what I say to thee:
I'm feeling so free
Call me Nina Simone;
And I'm like a carrier pigeon
'Cause even when I am sent from the dark trenches
I always find home, always find home

I know I leave a bad taste
Better take a peppermint;
Now, I take a lot of falls
But I rise, like a revenant
Take that, like a decree, written by the government
Or take it like a stone covenant

I don't like to deal with the attitudes
I just like to recite my Beatitudes
Whilst confronted with vicissitudes
Chasin';
Bakin';
A couple hot rhymes in the makin';
Please don't be mistaken
I'm the kind of pig
Who's not afraid to eat the bacon

Even when the blight's imposin'
I know I'm chosen;
I keep my flows 'n'
I keep my nose
To the grindstone;
You can call me Rushmore
'Cause my flow's stone

I'm tryna make the rhymes wavy
Tryna make 'em savory like gravy;
Tryna make a rhythm and a verse
Call me crazy;
Even if I end up in a hearse
As the driver or the one in the pall
Notwithstanding
I'm finna risk it all
Nonetheless
I'll jump at risk of fall
Yeah, I'll jump at risk of fall

Nearly drowned but I'm okay
Went to Triton with a bouquet
Saw a bull and I said olé
Then I went on my merry way

Poems like a powder keg
Like I'm living in the Balkans
In 1914;
Give me protein
Give me something
I just need to keep my sugar up;
Adimpleate my cup
Observe the chalice from which I sup
All the malice with which I put up

Drink, drink, drink
From the sink, sink, sink's
What I do, get a clue
Let me explain it to you:
I, dip my two hands in the water
And bring them to mouth
Like a member of Gideon's army
So even if things were to go so far south
I just know all my senses are set to alarm me

Lots of people want to make a lasting matrimony
With their misery
They need advisory
They're the kind of ones to put their mouths to the river
Taking both eyes off the enemy

I'm a chosen one
Even whilst I'm drinking from the faucet, son;
I keep the rhymes spinning
Like a merry-go-round;
Man, I'm so in love with writing that I merge it with sound;
And
When I'm writin'
I just seem to see the storm encroachin'
Even whilst I'm in the fields sowin'
I'm still able to see blight approachin'

I keep myself calm
I'm a monk from Tibet;
And if you must drain me
Then try your pipet
I'm the ocean
You will get wet;
I'm an underdog
Make a good bet

Call me Galapagos, I am evolved;
See all the things in which I am involved;
Many a quandary conquered and solved;
Many a salt that I've gone and dissolved

Gotta give the credit to above;
Gotta give my love
To my kinfolk
All the same folk
Who did raise me when I was yolk
And I also thank my kith
Some were friendly
Some were surly
But I've always pushed on heartily
Like Odysseus in myth

Witness revolution like a Leonora Sansay;
I dispatch with opposition, you can call me sensei;
I dream all day
Then write all night
And, you will find, I bear such great respect for plight

People, all around, haven't earned my trust
Rather sit here and drown
Than give you my brush

Spend my days down low, low, low
And I won't give up
Either pen or flow

I walk all around
And see creatures crowned
And I feel the ground beneath
Shake as they're given wreath

I hear call of the seas
Mast and canvas are my flow

Feeling like writing a villanelle and some quatrains;
Feeling sweetness like vanilla coursing through my veins;
Familiar sensation of the craft taking soul's reins;
Recognizing pitter-patter of creativity's rains

Chasing
Not for the cup of the liquor
But for my vocation;
Pacing
Not for the sake to be sicker
But for the pure reason of patience

Long into the night I work upon my craft;
I've been swimming in the sea
Without even inflated raft;
All that's certain in this life is uncertainty
While you're searching for surety
I'm in love with insanity

If you cry Ma
It won't buy time;
I've been walking in the tundra
In dead of night;
And I sing my songs
So I don't lose sight;
I know all the creatures
Are drawn to the light

Haven't found a lover on my lonely trail
'Cause my uncle always taught me chase more than tail;
I'm the kind of brother that'll seek life's wrath
For sake of blood to write a tale

Closing my eyelids I see my moira, yeah, see I my fate
Which is another reason nothing on this earth can hope me sate

Sweet
I look like cinnamon;
Sour
Tasting from my lemon pen;
Wheat
I separate it from the chaff;
Power as I use my staff

Swinging like a Tarzan
Through the jungle—Wisdom;
Spray can—I am—
Making art on the walls of the mausoleums
'Spite the spectators of the coliseums;
I know it appalls but I draw on the palls;
And I speed it up
And I do not pause;
I'm a shepherd to the flock and I see the paws
Of the wolf in the midst of the sheep—
Big jaws

That I'm deranged
Liking wrong dogs
With the right mange

I keep hungry, as I go;
I keep steaming, midst the snow;
All my brothers and my sisters see my notepad and they know

Falling, deeper
Midst all, the flames;
When hedge, is steeper
More fun, are games

All my poems
Manufactured to be seminal;
Reaper roams
But I do not walk on tippy-toes;
See ten tombs
But I've noticed only nine are full
You say that pall's for me, you fool
Don't you see I am the ghoul

Don't say I need a gold chain
Or a beat change
Imma maintain
Like a mountain
Untamed;
Do say
That I write strange
That I'm deranged
Liking wrong dogs
With the right mange

Even with a mean dog
One can glean so much from fleas on coat;
Given just a rusty cog
You know what truth some poets wrote?

School's an intellectual
Penitentiary
But I'll still unravel spool
And sew with glee

Writing big buck raps in the bathroom
Stalls;
It appalls
Many
When they find out I get up so quickly from my falls

I till
And I sow;
Got my whip
And lasso

Securing the bag, give me the gold;
Breaking the caste, breaking the mold;
Do what you're told, never do fold
Dichotomy, in the belly of philosophy;
Always watch your back when you're honing luminosity
'Cause a lot of people harbor lots of animosity

I can see the world
Through the tip of my pen;
If you put me in the box
I'm like a bull in a pen;
I've been swimming with my hands tied
Searching for ken
And I've been asking all around
Where have you been?

Death, be not, proud
Why swell'st thou?
Imma make my momma proud
Afore you get the chance to wrap me in a shroud

Uncle, I have been chosen;
On ken I'm a barnacle
On wisdom frozen;
Momma, I have been brazen
Amidst those in coma
And those who are craven

Don't say I need a gold chain
Or a beat change
Imma maintain
Like a mountain
Untamed;
Do say
That I write strange
That I'm deranged
Liking wrong dogs
With the right mange

Never picking sleep over prime cogitation
Or fine conversation;
If I need a boost then I look in reflection
If I grow glum then introspection
If I'm just a little off
In a little deed
It's a little seed
So I spend some time in retrospection
Overall I like soul's inspection
'Cause I believe in quelling things within incunabula
Never waiting for a thing to suck me dry—Dracula
If I come a baby spider then I leave tarantula
If I come a beggar then I lеave a king—fabula

Daddy always said, "Fear the living, not thе dead,"
Mommy always said, "Work less, use your head,"
And every single day
I mold a little clay
And walk a merry way
And I will some day say:
It's my admission
I am the harvest that came to fruition
Smooth despite friction
Bathed in the lake of each sweet benediction
Keeping conviction in spite of confliction
And even my diction's survived liquidation
And even my flesh has survived the sensation
Of arid words and castigation
Of acrid thoughts and rumination;
I've learned to search for lumination
Midst the black and degradation
And if you want and explanation
Here is my delineation:
Every night I close my eyes
I lock my door—
Avoid surprise—
So I may wake to sun partake
And know my life shan't me forsake
I have:
A little more to bake
A little more to break
A little more air for my lungs to in take
A little more blood for the struggle's sake
I'll fight in the now and forget about the wake;
I've sight for the stars
Skin for the scars
Ink for the bars
Grins for the fight
Smiles for the blight
Vision for the night
And love for the right;
Spinning tasty rhymes like a loom in a cake
Ice to the cream, snow to the flake
Size to leviathan, fire to a drake
Runes innate like plates to a quake

Nature versus nurture
Half the soil
Half the seed
If you take the time to picture it
My toil's like a weed
Sown in loam and I'm prepared
To make the gardener's fingers bleed

Know the Devil dances during Holy Week
Know the kinds of demons you will find
Upon that road and bloody peak
There's a kind of filth that you can't wash off in the shower
But I'm never one to cower from a bite of something sour

[NVRENDS]
Hey
I see you looking at me
Now watch your step before you trip and fall right under my feet
Hey
What is it that you seek
Do you really want a piecе of me six feet deep

You bring the match 
I'll bring the kеrosine 
Start a fire, bury me
Come back up again like a Phoenix 
You will remember me
Like a demon in the dark 
Creeping in the shadows, smart
Think ahead, light me up 
And rip my enemies apart 

[137]
Sipping wine in Gethsemane, waiting on my enemies
I eat the pomegranate seeds but pay price like Persephone
You love me now but how long till you choose to crucify me
Those aren't hickeys, I get lapel choked by craft's reality

[NVRENDS]
Pass me the pen and a pad 
I'll write again and again when you're mad
Flip up the switch and I'll change it right back
Back in my day I was more than just bad
I was worse than the devil on top of my back
Pick up the shovel now dig up the facts 
Test me again and I'll push you right back
Down to your level I'll take out the trash 

Throw away every hope and dream you have 
Of me sinking down you're mad
Cuz you'll never see what I see
God damn be a man
You keep on wasting all my time
Creeping down my fucking spine
You hate your life because you can't have mine

[137]
Got no bench in marathon
I'm running like Iditarod
I'm searching for the seventh side
While looking at a pentagon
I see so many full of it
I'm handing out some enemas

The bigger the star, the shorter it burns
And I got a carbon core, so I can't be taciturn

I got no want for the hidden animosity
Shed blood for the sake of luminosity
Got a cornerman above with some bloody towels

Quite a thing to keep down in bowels
Fecund fields, plucked by crows
See procession of muddy cowls
Trudged right through where Charon rows

Want myself a Misa Misa
If I become Mansa Musa
Are those hooves or are they heels
One more snake, I could make Medusa

Have you seen the shadows outside of the limelight
Have you seen the lands that I traveled when I write
It's times like these in which I wouldn't mind to be tearful
They say my path is manifest but it's only patent in hindsight

[NVRENDS]
Hey
I see you looking at me
Now watch your step before you trip and fall right under my feet

I'm tryna make the rhymes wavy
Tryna make 'em savory like gravy;
Tryna make a rhythm and a verse
Call me crazy;
Even if I end up in a hearse
As the driver or the one in the pall
Notwithstanding
I'm finna risk it all
Nonetheless
I'll jump at risk of fall
Yeah, I'll jump at risk of fall

Nearly drowned but I'm okay
Went to Triton with a bouquet
Saw a bull and I said olé
Then I went on my merry way

Poems like a powder keg
Like I'm living in the Balkans
In 1914;
Give me protein
Give me something
I just need to keep my sugar up;
Adimpleate my cup
Observe the chalice from which I sup
All the malice with which I put up

Drink, drink, drink
From the sink, sink, sink's
What I do, get a clue
Let me explain it to you:
I, dip my two hands in the water
And bring them to mouth
Like a member of Gideon's army
So even if things were to go so far south
I just know all my senses are set to alarm me

Lots of people want to make a lasting matrimony
With their misery
They need advisory
They're the kind of ones to put their mouths to the river
Taking both eyes off the enemy

I'm a chosen one
Even whilst I'm drinking from the faucet, son;
I keep the rhymes spinning
Like a merry-go-round;
Man, I'm so in love with writing that I merge it with sound;
And
When I'm writin'
I just seem to see the storm encroachin'
Even whilst I'm in the fields sowin'
I'm still able to see blight approachin'

I keep myself calm
I'm a monk from Tibet;
And if you must drain me
Then try your pipet
I'm the ocean
You will get wet;
I'm an underdog
Make a good bet

Call me Galapagos, I am evolved;
See all the things in which I am involved;
Many a quandary conquered and solved;
Many a salt that I've gone and dissolved

Gotta give the credit to above;
Gotta give my love
To my kinfolk
All the same folk
Who did raise me when I was yolk
And I also thank my kith
Some were friendly
Some were surly
But I've always pushed on heartily
Like Odysseus in myth

Witness revolution like a Leonora Sansay;
I dispatch with opposition, you can call me sensei;
I dream all day
Then write all night
And, you will find, I bear such great respect for plight

People, all around, haven't earned my trust
Rather sit here and drown
Than give you my brush

Spend my days down low, low, low
And I won't give up
Either pen or flow

I walk all around
And see creatures crowned
And I feel the ground beneath
Shake as they're given wreath

All the waiting, and the pain
Not complaining, I'm just saying:
Don't think everybody is built for it
Of the art I am no counterfeit
And I'll tell you right now
'Bout the fruit you bit
It's a dubious meal so do watch your shh—
Hear footsteps and I am not pacing
Popped the pill of life and the art was the lacing
Now I feel my heart is really palpitating
And I can feel upon my tongue it's color I'm tasting;
Oh my, I'm really feeling loopy
Peering at my dog and she looks like Snoopy

Knowing all the days may appear as dreary
And flesh may be weary but my eyes ain't droopy

[J.$pirit]
Oh my
Oh my
Said shawty know it's go time
Go time
Bout to hit em with the closed Sign
This that do not disturb
Gotta be focused while we working on the curves
Oh girl I swear you sway me
What I gotta do to call you baby
She serving them looks so crazy
Shawty been on 10 no maybe yeah
You my kryptonite but save me
Yeah
These days you love then hate me
Bro said don't let no female change me
She the only one posting me one the daily
If I die
Knock on wood
If i die
She better say
I was the realist one alive
Wanna kiss again before I reach the sky
She a bad bad need to testify
But I really know better
She don't give no effort
I ain't finna go go get her
Spirit told me no pressure
Abundance on your header
A Real nigga trigger but I will not pull the lever
All these hoes
Want the cheat code
Better let me know
That we've been bold
That's we've been cold
If need something true
Let me know
I'm really done with all these episode

Left late but I wish she stayed
'Cause I like the games that our hips did play
But I, know that I gotta go my way
'Cause I know I gotta keep the Piper paid

Sleep light 'cause I know my sins
If I sleep tight then the Reaper wins
And I know my path's not done
My sand's got a little more to run

Riding in my fleshly morgue as a limousine;
Feeling all the ridges of the automatic's magazine;
And I know a lot of people may not get all that I mean
But I hope at least they smile when they see me paint a scene

The bitter correlation is the more you get sicker
The more you have to have your finger hover round the trigger

[J.$pirit]
Boom clap
Spirit intact
Lately these days I just want to get back
To the person that I was
The one that didn't hate the club
I would steady cop a dub
Have a baddie roll It up
Then She turned into my everything
Yeah my everything
Grim reaper hovering
It's a murder thing
Put me in coffin
Me shawty done talking
I ain't even done bossing
And my greatness just walked in
Yeah I may have been addicted
But my paradigm shifted
Only listen to the mystics
But Im still gonna miss yo cherry lipstick
And It's really crazy for me
Rerun the episodes let the cycle repeat
Peace

Want to
Know what
I do
Write about
Each day
I suppose
I just
Describe
The creatures
In one's
Attic space

I don't got a favorite style
I do what the beat beckons;
Always been wary of smiles
Specially from Sirens;
I've been called bibliophile
(Seeing what page reckons);
At the feast of wisdom
Man, I go back for my seconds

All of the venom is not an anomaly
Know it's indicative of a disease;
I have been looking around for the comedy
Midst all the filth and the pestilent fleas

Oh my, had to scrape some people up from my floor
So I could deliver them back to their own door
Funny how good liquor can eliminate the senses
Couple downed shots and they're messing up decor;
And I got a message for the housing authorities
Your enforcement is so filled with big holes and deformities

I, keep the club bouncing like Tigger;
Fie, many don't keep the same vigor;
Sigh, little things can really get bigger
If you got a problem try to pull the fucking trigger

Listen, I don't want to have an attitude
So I'll try to say this without even being rude
I don't want to be that person rejoicing in ostracization
But won't you see the fucking enemies accrued

Please
I do not want your advice
I'm more obliged to throw my bloody dice
Than listen to someone who's not in the trenches
Please name me a coach who instructs from the benches

Said this before, happily, I'll say it again:
If you don't understand the truth coming out of my pen
Then I do suggest you put on your reading glasses
Wouldn't understand me if I fucking spoke molasses

Listen to me
That's not a strike to the ones who don't get it at first
It's a strike to the ones who drink the most and have the least of thirst
It's a reproach of the hungry roach that tries to spoil kitchen goods
It's a castigation of the wolves that roam within the woods

When I was younger, didn't have that many friends
And I pushed all through my hunger so I could—my field—till
Then I got older, and you know how the path bends
Well the only hunger I now have is for the fucking quill

I don't got a favorite style
I do what the beat beckons;
Always been wary of smiles
Specially from Sirens;
I've been called bibliophile
(Seeing what page reckons);
At the feast of wisdom
Man, I go back for my seconds

Gloom, when I came out the womb
But I made the best of my gilded tomb;
Doom, at the bottom of life's flume
Fee-fi-fo-fum, giants need room

Don't need a gold chain
Just want a bigger, bigger crowd
For the arcane runes that I been sprayin';
And yes I do want brain
But I'm talking 'bout the one in head
Not the one for which you're prayin'

I, keep the club bouncing like Tigger;
Fie, many don't keep the same vigor;
Sigh, little things can really get bigger

For what's another river 'thout the moisture

I must say I'm:
Rigid like I'm Young Modulus
I, shoot I don't miss
I, see target's fate
I, know beast to sate
I, see it's hard for a lot of brothers to relate
Not going for the check, going for the mate

Only so long, you can be a sunflower
Then you gotta bear fruit, or cowеr, it's true;
Only so long, you ensconce in thе tower
Then you gotta cast your locks down in the mire

Short life of movement
Is sweeter
Than long life
Of stagnancy

I use all my ken for the culture
For what's another river 'thout the moisture

Oftentimes I find it hard to mop my own kitchen
'Cause when I look into the glass I don't see my reflection
I see another brother with encumbrance on his back
Like I'm wading in the murky waters awaiting a shark attack

I could sell ice to an eskimo
Making humid raps dripping with the flow
Flying with the crow
On my shoulder;
I'm a climber
Life's a boulder;
I'm a suitcase
You're a folder

I'm a dirigible—
Individual so likely to rise
'Cause he's seminal—
It's almost criminal
Crafting the rhymes that I do
Whilst being so far from ephemeral;
I go straight on red
'Cause through I keep my head
I rather wash up dead
Than write my runes abed;
I'll pick He every single time over lead
And watch where my feet in the snake pit tread

He's the kind of brother that'll interrupt Mass

I pick up my pen
So words can get dancing;
I am the poacher
You keep on prancing;
Give you the Maxim
But I guarantee I'm still advancing;
Many a maxim

I just seem to see the storm encroachin'
Even whilst I'm in the fields sowin'
I'm still able to see blight approachin'

I'm tryna make the rhymes wavy
Tryna make 'em savory like gravy;
Tryna make a rhythm and a verse
Call me crazy;
Even if I end up in a hearse
As the driver or the one in the pall
Notwithstanding
I'm finna risk it all
Nonetheless
I'll jump at risk of fall
Yeah, I'll jump at risk of fall

Nearly drowned but I'm okay
Went to Triton with a bouquet
Saw a bull and I said olé
Then I went on my merry way

Poems like a powder keg
Like I'm living in the Balkans
In 1914;
Give me protein
Give me something
I just need to keep my sugar up;
Adimpleate my cup
Observe the chalice from which I sup
All the malice with which I put up

Drink, drink, drink
From the sink, sink, sink's
What I do, get a clue
Let me explain it to you:
I, dip my two hands in the water
And bring them to mouth
Like a member of Gideon's army
So even if things were to go so far south
I just know all my senses are set to alarm me

Lots of people want to make a lasting matrimony
With their misery
They need advisory
They're the kind of ones to put their mouths to the river
Taking both eyes off the enemy

I'm a chosen one
Even whilst I'm drinking from the faucet, son;
I keep the rhymes spinning
Like a merry-go-round;
Man, I'm so in love with writing that I merge it with sound;
And
When I'm writin'
I just seem to see the storm encroachin'
Even whilst I'm in the fields sowin'
I'm still able to see blight approachin'

I keep myself calm
I'm a monk from Tibet;
And if you must drain me
Then try your pipet
I'm the ocean
You will get wet;
I'm an underdog
Make a good bet

Call me Galapagos, I am evolved;
See all the things in which I am involved;
Many a quandary conquered and solved;
Many a salt that I've gone and dissolved

Gotta give the credit to above;
Gotta give my love
To my kinfolk
All the same folk
Who did raise me when I was yolk
And I also thank my kith
Some were friendly
Some were surly
But I've always pushed on heartily
Like Odysseus in myth

Witness revolution like a Leonora Sansay;
I dispatch with opposition, you can call me sensei;
I dream all day
Then write all night
And, you will find, I bear such great respect for plight

People, all around, haven't earned my trust
Rather sit here and drown
Than give you my brush

Spend my days down low, low, low
And I won't give up
Either pen or flow

I walk all around
And see creatures crowned
And I feel the ground beneath
Shake as they're given wreath

And the clouds are mourning

Take my leather-bound journal to the Lethe
All the wayworn souls by that river won't forget me

Frozen
In the bitter blizzard that's called
Wisdom
Build a brazen movement
Then a kingdom

You lost reverence
Because of close proximity
Your residence
Is in the bowеls of normalcy
Sages eaten

Know I
Do keep a pеn in my vicinity
Able to knight a willing subject
Upon a bended knee

Don't vie
For my vantage point, unpreparedly
'Cause you might be harrowed
By the things your inner eyes will see

Pick a card
Wonder who you'll meet upon the boulevard
Of your dreams
Met the Reaper just the other day
The scenes with themes
Macabre
Are embedded in my very seams
Abracadabra
Create as I speak and I speak as it truly seems

Speak too much truth
Gotta lie low
Hard to spit a rhyme while in Hades with a halo

I feel craft is the lotion to dryness
When you next address me
You may utter words: Your Highness

Build a brazen movement

And all throughout my lifetime
I've been running and writing
And sour like a fresh lime

I'm like a puma roaming through the mountain
I go and eat my prey
And then I drink from the fountain
Of knowledge
Not something just gleaned from college
I gulp it down like it's porridge

Call me Goldilocks
I like kinky locks
You can also call me water
I'm a universal solvent
'Cause every time I spit a rhyme
Everything dissolves, yep
Man, it dissociates
Call your associates
I am a fisherman with all the best of baits
I am a mеal which always—the stomach—sates
I am a gym with the bеst equipment and weights

I'm brushin'
Flossin'
Sharpening my teeth
So I
Can chomp
Down on
All I need

Man, you really gotta keep your skin hardened
Ears perked up
Eyes open
Always hopin'
Never chokin'
In the misery
Fighting for your inner glee;
Step to me
This is what I say to thee:
I'm feeling so free
Call me Nina Simone;
And I'm like a carrier pigeon
'Cause even when I am sent from the dark trenches
I always find home, always find home

I know I leave a bad taste
Better take a peppermint;
Now, I take a lot of falls
But I rise, like a revenant
Take that, like a decree, written by the government
Or take it like a stone covenant

I don't like to deal with the attitudes
I just like to recite my Beatitudes
Whilst confronted with vicissitudes
Chasin';
Bakin';
A couple hot rhymes in the makin';
Please don't be mistaken
I'm the kind of pig
Who's not afraid to eat the bacon

Even when the blight's imposin'
I know I'm chosen;
I keep my flows 'n'
I keep my nose
To the grindstone;
You can call me Rushmore
'Cause my flow's stone

Nature versus nurture
Half the soil
Half the seed
If you take the time to picture it
My toil's like a weed
Sown in loam and I'm prepared
To make the gardener's fingers bleed

Know the Devil dances during Holy Week
Know the kinds of demons you will find
Upon that road and bloody peak
There's a kind of filth that you can't wash off in the shower
But I'm never one to cower from a bite of something sour

[NVRENDS]
Hey
I see you looking at me
Now watch your step before you trip and fall right under my feet
Hey
What is it that you seek
Do you really want a piecе of me six feet deep

You bring the match 
I'll bring the kеrosine 
Start a fire, bury me
Come back up again like a Phoenix 
You will remember me
Like a demon in the dark 
Creeping in the shadows, smart
Think ahead, light me up 
And rip my enemies apart 

[137]
Sipping wine in Gethsemane, waiting on my enemies
I eat the pomegranate seeds but pay price like Persephone
You love me now but how long till you choose to crucify me
Those aren't hickeys, I get lapel choked by craft's reality

[NVRENDS]
Pass me the pen and a pad 
I'll write again and again when you're mad
Flip up the switch and I'll change it right back
Back in my day I was more than just bad
I was worse than the devil on top of my back
Pick up the shovel now dig up the facts 
Test me again and I'll push you right back
Down to your level I'll take out the trash 

Throw away every hope and dream you have 
Of me sinking down you're mad
Cuz you'll never see what I see
God damn be a man
You keep on wasting all my time
Creeping down my fucking spine
You hate your life because you can't have mine

[137]
Got no bench in marathon
I'm running like Iditarod
I'm searching for the seventh side
While looking at a pentagon
I see so many full of it
I'm handing out some enemas

The bigger the star, the shorter it burns
And I got a carbon core, so I can't be taciturn

I got no want for the hidden animosity
Shed blood for the sake of luminosity
Got a cornerman above with some bloody towels

Quite a thing to keep down in bowels
Fecund fields, plucked by crows
See procession of muddy cowls
Trudged right through where Charon rows

Want myself a Misa Misa
If I become Mansa Musa
Are those hooves or are they heels
One more snake, I could make Medusa

Have you seen the shadows outside of the limelight
Have you seen the lands that I traveled when I write
It's times like these in which I wouldn't mind to be tearful
They say my path is manifest but it's only patent in hindsight

[NVRENDS]
Hey
I see you looking at me
Now watch your step before you trip and fall right under my feet
Hey
What is it that you seek
Do you really want a piece of me six feet deep

Said this before, happily, I'll say it again:

Wouldn't understand me if I fucking spoke molasses

It's a strike to the ones who drink the most and have the least of thirst
It's a reproach of the hungry roach that tries to spoil kitchen goods
It's a castigation of the wolves that roam within the woods

When I was younger, didn't have that many friends
And I pushed all through my hunger so I could—my field—till
Then I got older, and you know how the path bends
Well the only hunger I now have is for the fucking quill

And I can feel upon my tongue it's color I'm tasting;
Oh my, I'm really feeling loopy
Peering at my dog and she looks like Snoopy

Knowing all the days may appear as dreary
And flesh may be weary but my eyes ain't droopy

Oh my
Oh my
Said shawty know it's go time
Go time
Bout to hit em with the closed Sign
This that do not disturb
Gotta be focused while we working on the curves
Oh girl I swear you sway me
What I gotta do to call you baby
She serving them looks so crazy
Shawty been on 10 no maybe yeah
You my kryptonite but save me
Yeah
These days you love then hate me
Bro said don't let no female change me
She the only one posting me one the daily
If I die
Knock on wood
If i die
She better say
I was the realist one alive
Wanna kiss again before I reach the sky
She a bad bad need to testify
But I really know better
She don't give no effort
I ain't finna go go get her
Spirit told me no pressure
Abundance on your header
A Real nigga trigger but I will not pull the lever
All these hoes
Want the cheat code
Better let me know
That we've been bold
That's we've been cold
If need something true
Let me know
I'm really done with all these episode

Sleep light 'cause I know my sins
If I sleep tight then the Reaper wins
And I know my path's not done
My sand's got a little more to run

Riding in my fleshly morgue as a limousine;
Feeling all the ridges of the automatic's magazine;
And I know a lot of people may not get all that I mean
But I hope at least they smile when they see me paint a scene

The bitter correlation is the more you get sicker
The more you have to have your finger hover round the trigger

Boom clap
Spirit intact
Lately these days I just want to get back
To the person that I was
The one that didn't hate the club
I would steady cop a dub
Have a baddie roll It up
Then She turned into my everything
Yeah my everything
Grim reaper hovering
It's a murder thing
Put me in coffin
Me shawty done talking
I ain't even done bossing
And my greatness just walked in
Yeah I may have been addicted
But my paradigm shifted
Only listen to the mystics
But Im still gonna miss yo cherry lipstick
And It's really crazy for me
Rerun the episodes let the cycle repeat
Peace

Popped the pill of life and the art was the lacing
Now I feel my heart is really palpitating
And I can feel upon my tongue it's color I'm tasting;
Oh my, I'm really feeling loopy
Peering at my dog and she looks like Snoopy

Knowing all the days may appear as dreary
And flesh may be weary but my eyes ain't droopy

[J.$pirit]
Oh my
Oh my
Said shawty know it's go time
Go time
Bout to hit em with the closed Sign
This that do not disturb
Gotta be focused while we working on the curves
Oh girl I swear you sway me
What I gotta do to call you baby
She serving them looks so crazy
Shawty been on 10 no maybe yeah
You my kryptonite but save me
Yeah
These days you love then hate me
Bro said don't let no female change me
She the only one posting me one the daily
If I die
Knock on wood
If i die
She better say
I was the realist one alive
Wanna kiss again before I reach the sky
She a bad bad need to testify
But I really know better
She don't give no effort
I ain't finna go go get her
Spirit told me no pressure
Abundance on your header
A Real nigga trigger but I will not pull the lever
All these hoes
Want the cheat code
Better let me know
That we've been bold
That's we've been cold
If need something true
Let me know
I'm really done with all these episode

[137]
Left late but I wish she stayed
'Cause I like the games that our hips did play
But I, know that I gotta go my way
'Cause I know I gotta keep the Piper paid

Sleep light 'cause I know my sins
If I sleep tight then the Reaper wins
And I know my path's not done
My sand's got a little more to run

Riding in my fleshly morgue as a limousine;
Feeling all the ridges of the automatic's magazine;
And I know a lot of people may not get all that I mean
But I hope at least they smile when they see me paint a scene

The bitter correlation is the more you get sicker
The more you have to have your finger hover round the trigger

[J.$pirit]
Boom clap
Spirit intact
Lately these days I just want to get back
To the person that I was
The one that didn't hate the club
I would steady cop a dub
Have a baddie roll It up
Then She turned into my everything
Yeah my everything
Grim reaper hovering
It's a murder thing
Put me in coffin
Me shawty done talking
I ain't even done bossing
And my greatness just walked in
Yeah I may have been addicted
But my paradigm shifted
Only listen to the mystics
But Im still gonna miss yo cherry lipstick
And It's really crazy for me
Rerun the episodes let the cycle repeat
Peace

Left late but I wish she stayed

And all throughout my lifetime
I've been running and writing
And sour like a fresh lime

I'm like a puma roaming through the mountain
I go and eat my prey
And then I drink from the fountain
Of knowledge
Not something just gleaned from college
I gulp it down like it's porridge

Call me Goldilocks
I like kinky locks
You can also call me water
I'm a universal solvent
'Cause every time I spit a rhyme
Everything dissolves, yep
Man, it dissociates
Call your associates
I am a fisherman with all the best of baits
I am a mеal which always—the stomach—sates
I am a gym with the bеst equipment and weights

I'm brushin'
Flossin'
Sharpening my teeth
So I
Can chomp
Down on
All I need

Man, you really gotta keep your skin hardened
Ears perked up
Eyes open
Always hopin'
Never chokin'
In the misery
Fighting for your inner glee;
Step to me
This is what I say to thee:
I'm feeling so free
Call me Nina Simone;
And I'm like a carrier pigeon
'Cause even when I am sent from the dark trenches
I always find home, always find home

I know I leave a bad taste
Better take a peppermint;
Now, I take a lot of falls
But I rise, like a revenant
Take that, like a decree, written by the government
Or take it like a stone covenant

I don't like to deal with the attitudes
I just like to recite my Beatitudes
Whilst confronted with vicissitudes
Chasin';
Bakin';
A couple hot rhymes in the makin';
Please don't be mistaken
I'm the kind of pig
Who's not afraid to eat the bacon

Even when the blight's imposin'
I know I'm chosen;
I keep my flows 'n'
I keep my nose
To the grindstone;
You can call me Rushmore
'Cause my flow's stone

Nature versus nurture
Half the soil
Half the seed
If you take the time to picture it
My toil's like a weed
Sown in loam and I'm prepared
To make the gardener's fingers bleed

Know the Devil dances during Holy Week
Know the kinds of demons you will find
Upon that road and bloody peak
There's a kind of filth that you can't wash off in the shower
But I'm never one to cower from a bite of something sour

[NVRENDS]
Hey
I see you looking at me
Now watch your step before you trip and fall right under my feet
Hey
What is it that you seek
Do you really want a piecе of me six feet deep

You bring the match 
I'll bring the kеrosine 
Start a fire, bury me
Come back up again like a Phoenix 
You will remember me
Like a demon in the dark 
Creeping in the shadows, smart
Think ahead, light me up 
And rip my enemies apart 

[137]
Sipping wine in Gethsemane, waiting on my enemies
I eat the pomegranate seeds but pay price like Persephone
You love me now but how long till you choose to crucify me
Those aren't hickeys, I get lapel choked by craft's reality

[NVRENDS]
Pass me the pen and a pad 
I'll write again and again when you're mad
Flip up the switch and I'll change it right back
Back in my day I was more than just bad
I was worse than the devil on top of my back
Pick up the shovel now dig up the facts 
Test me again and I'll push you right back
Down to your level I'll take out the trash 

Throw away every hope and dream you have 
Of me sinking down you're mad
Cuz you'll never see what I see
God damn be a man
You keep on wasting all my time
Creeping down my fucking spine
You hate your life because you can't have mine

[137]
Got no bench in marathon
I'm running like Iditarod
I'm searching for the seventh side
While looking at a pentagon
I see so many full of it
I'm handing out some enemas

The bigger the star, the shorter it burns
And I got a carbon core, so I can't be taciturn

I got no want for the hidden animosity
Shed blood for the sake of luminosity
Got a cornerman above with some bloody towels

Quite a thing to keep down in bowels
Fecund fields, plucked by crows
See procession of muddy cowls
Trudged right through where Charon rows

Want myself a Misa Misa
If I become Mansa Musa
Are those hooves or are they heels
One more snake, I could make Medusa

Have you seen the shadows outside of the limelight
Have you seen the lands that I traveled when I write
It's times like these in which I wouldn't mind to be tearful
They say my path is manifest but it's only patent in hindsight

[NVRENDS]
Hey
I see you looking at me
Now watch your step before you trip and fall right under my feet
Hey
What is it that you seek
Do you really want a piece of me six feet deep

Forgiving, not indulgent
Tryna craft my verses so they're cogent
Thin lines between the aforementioned pairs;
I've seen how tension wears
Fields free from tares are my greatest cares

I've seen some better days
And I've known some better nights
Nonetheless, my ardor stays
Cedar to termites

I never really realized
I wasn't truly baptized
Till I was able to put my life upon a table
And watch the feeble cable upon which it all relies
And take my taste of vale's lies

I've sown some mighty seeds
And have flown amongst the crows;
I have seen how pencil bleeds
O'er Styx my pen rows

I
Have seen the Reaper
In
The eyes of man

Cold
Are jeers of critics;
Bold
I must stand

It feels off to take a girl out on my mother's money
So I do seek secure the bag
I'm not frontin' for honey

But I don't need dough for some idle beauty
Pen's all I need for my kind of duty
Scratch of the paper'll do it for me
If I bleed for the craft I can write a story

I don't want to spend my life beholden to the banal;
If you know me you know I see writing on the panel

Chosen
Easy to forget when you're surrounded;
Blinded
By the sickly seeds which Orchard's founded on;
I'm not a pawn
I am the board upon which the game is played upon

Fall to my knees;
I will sail how I know;
I hear call of the seas
Mast and canvas are my flow

Feeling like writing a villanelle and some quatrains;
Feeling sweetness like vanilla coursing through my veins;
Familiar sensation of the craft taking soul's reins;
Recognizing pitter-patter of creativity's rains

Chasing
Not for the cup of the liquor
But for my vocation;
Pacing
Not for the sake to be sicker
But for the pure reason of patience

Long into the night I work upon my craft;
I've been swimming in the sea
Without even inflated raft;
All that's certain in this life is uncertainty
While you're searching for surety
I'm in love with insanity

If you cry Ma
It won't buy time;
I've been walking in the tundra
In dead of night;
And I sing my songs
So I don't lose sight;
I know all the creatures
Are drawn to the light

Haven't found a lover on my lonely trail
'Cause my uncle always taught me chase more than tail;
I'm the kind of brother that'll seek life's wrath
For sake of blood to write a tale

Closing my eyelids I see my moira, yeah, see I my fate
Which is another reason nothing on this earth can hope me sate

Sweet
I look like cinnamon;
Sour
Tasting from my lemon pen;
Wheat
I separate it from the chaff;
Power as I use my staff

Swinging like a Tarzan
Through the jungle—Wisdom;
Spray can—I am—
Making art on the walls of the mausoleums
'Spite the spectators of the coliseums;
I know it appalls but I draw on the palls;
And I speed it up
And I do not pause;
I'm a shepherd to the flock and I see the paws
Of the wolf in the midst of the sheep—
Big jaws

If you cry Ma
It won't buy time;
I've been walking in the tundra
In dead of night;
And I sing my songs
So I don't lose sight;
I know all the creatures
Are drawn to the light
