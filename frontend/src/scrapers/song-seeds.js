You!
Why do they always send the poor?

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Barbarisms by Barbaras with pointed heels
Victorious Victoria’s kneel for brand new spanking deals
Marching forward, hypocritic and hypnotic computers
You depend on our protection, yet you feed us lies from the table cloth

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox, stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil, crying, "Freedom"
Handed to obsoletion, still, you feed us lies from the table cloth

[Chorus: Serj Tankian with Daron Malakian]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine

[Bridge: Daron Malakian]
Blast off, it's party time
And we don't live in a fascist nation
Blast off, it's party time
And where the fuck are you?

[Refrain: Daron Malakian with Serj Tankian]
Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why they always send the poor?

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox, stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil, crying, "Freedom"
Handed to obsoletion, still, you feed us lies from the table cloth

[Chorus: Serj Tankian with Daron Malakian]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sun

Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?

[Outro: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]

Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?

So hopeful
Through night
And day;
No sleep
Whilst load's full;
I fight
I pray

Don't say I need a gold chain
Or a beat change
Imma maintain
Like a mountain
Untamed;
Do say
That I write strange
That I'm deranged
Liking wrong dogs
With the right mange

I keep hungry, as I go;
I keep steaming, midst the snow;
All my brothers and my sisters see my notepad and they know

Falling, deeper
Midst all, the flames;
When hedge, is steeper
More fun, are games

All my poems
Manufactured to be seminal;
Reaper roams
But I do not walk on tippy-toes;
See ten tombs
But I've noticed only nine are full
You say that pall's for me, you fool
Don't you see I am the ghoul

Don't say I need a gold chain
Or a beat change
Imma maintain
Like a mountain
Untamed;
Do say
That I write strange
That I'm deranged
Liking wrong dogs
With the right mange

Even with a mean dog
One can glean so much from fleas on coat;
Given just a rusty cog
You know what truth some poets wrote?

School's an intellectual
Penitentiary
But I'll still unravel spool
And sew with glee

Writing big buck raps in the bathroom
Stalls;
It appalls
Many
When they find out I get up so quickly from my falls

I till
And I sow;
Got my whip
And lasso

Securing the bag, give me the gold;
Breaking the caste, breaking the mold;
Do what you're told, never do fold
Dichotomy, in the belly of philosophy;
Always watch your back when you're honing luminosity
'Cause a lot of people harbor lots of animosity

I can see the world
Through the tip of my pen;
If you put me in the box
I'm like a bull in a pen;
I've been swimming with my hands tied
Searching for ken
And I've been asking all around
Where have you been?

Death, be not, proud
Why swell'st thou?
Imma make my momma proud
Afore you get the chance to wrap me in a shroud

Uncle, I have been chosen;
On ken I'm a barnacle
On wisdom frozen;
Momma, I have been brazen
Amidst those in coma
And those who are craven

Don't say I need a gold chain
Or a beat change
Imma maintain
Like a mountain
Untamed;
Do say
That I write strange
That I'm deranged
Liking wrong dogs
With the right mange

I've been running and writing
And sour like a fresh lime

I'm like a puma roaming through the mountain
I go and eat my prey
And then I drink from the fountain
Of knowledge
Not something just gleaned from college
I gulp it down like it's porridge

Call me Goldilocks
I like kinky locks
You can also call me water
I'm a universal solvent
'Cause every time I spit a rhyme
Everything dissolves, yep
Man, it dissociates
Call your associates
I am a fisherman with all the best of baits
I am a mеal which always—the stomach—sates
I am a gym with the bеst equipment and weights

I'm brushin'
Flossin'
Sharpening my teeth
So I
Can chomp
Down on
All I need

Man, you really gotta keep your skin hardened
Ears perked up
Eyes open
Always hopin'
Never chokin'
In the misery
Fighting for your inner glee;
Step to me
This is what I say to thee:
I'm feeling so free
Call me Nina Simone;
And I'm like a carrier pigeon
'Cause even when I am sent from the dark trenches
I always find home, always find home

I know I leave a bad taste
Better take a peppermint;
Now, I take a lot of falls
But I rise, like a revenant
Take that, like a decree, written by the government
Or take it like a stone covenant

I don't like to deal with the attitudes
I just like to recite my Beatitudes
Whilst confronted with vicissitudes
Chasin';
Bakin';
A couple hot rhymes in the makin';
Please don't be mistaken
I'm the kind of pig
Who's not afraid to eat the bacon

Even when the blight's imposin'
I know I'm chosen;
I keep my flows 'n'
I keep my nose
To the grindstone;
You can call me Rushmore
'Cause my flow's stone

All the waiting, and the pain
Not complaining, I'm just saying:
Don't think everybody is built for it
Of the art I am no counterfeit
And I'll tell you right now
'Bout the fruit you bit
It's a dubious meal so do watch your shh—
Hear footsteps and I am not pacing
Popped the pill of life and the art was the lacing
Now I feel my heart is really palpitating
And I can feel upon my tongue it's color I'm tasting;
Oh my, I'm really feeling loopy
Peering at my dog and she looks like Snoopy

Knowing all the days may appear as dreary
And flesh may be weary but my eyes ain't droopy

[J.$pirit]
Oh my
Oh my
Said shawty know it's go time
Go time
Bout to hit em with the closed Sign
This that do not disturb
Gotta be focused while we working on the curves
Oh girl I swear you sway me
What I gotta do to call you baby
She serving them looks so crazy
Shawty been on 10 no maybe yeah
You my kryptonite but save me
Yeah
These days you love then hate me
Bro said don't let no female change me
She the only one posting me one the daily
If I die
Knock on wood
If i die
She better say
I was the realist one alive
Wanna kiss again before I reach the sky
She a bad bad need to testify
But I really know better
She don't give no effort
I ain't finna go go get her
Spirit told me no pressure
Abundance on your header
A Real nigga trigger but I will not pull the lever
All these hoes
Want the cheat code
Better let me know
That we've been bold
That's we've been cold
If need something true
Let me know
I'm really done with all these episode

Left late but I wish she stayed
'Cause I like the games that our hips did play
But I, know that I gotta go my way
'Cause I know I gotta keep the Piper paid

Sleep light 'cause I know my sins
If I sleep tight then the Reaper wins
And I know my path's not done
My sand's got a little more to run

Riding in my fleshly morgue as a limousine;
Feeling all the ridges of the automatic's magazine;
And I know a lot of people may not get all that I mean
But I hope at least they smile when they see me paint a scene

The bitter correlation is the more you get sicker
The more you have to have your finger hover round the trigger

[J.$pirit]
Boom clap
Spirit intact
Lately these days I just want to get back
To the person that I was
The one that didn't hate the club
I would steady cop a dub
Have a baddie roll It up
Then She turned into my everything
Yeah my everything
Grim reaper hovering
It's a murder thing
Put me in coffin
Me shawty done talking
I ain't even done bossing
And my greatness just walked in
Yeah I may have been addicted
But my paradigm shifted
Only listen to the mystics
But Im still gonna miss yo cherry lipstick
And It's really crazy for me
Rerun the episodes let the cycle repeat
Peace

Nature versus nurture
Half the soil
Half the seed
If you take the time to picture it
My toil's like a weed
Sown in loam and I'm prepared
To make the gardener's fingers bleed

Know the Devil dances during Holy Week
Know the kinds of demons you will find
Upon that road and bloody peak
There's a kind of filth that you can't wash off in the shower
But I'm never one to cower from a bite of something sour

[NVRENDS]
Hey
I see you looking at me
Now watch your step&nbsp;before you trip and fall right under my feet
Hey
What is it that you seek
Do you really want a piecе of me six feet deep

You bring the match&nbsp;
I'll bring the kеrosine&nbsp;
Start a fire, bury me
Come back up again like a Phoenix&nbsp;
You will remember me
Like a demon in the dark&nbsp;
Creeping in the shadows, smart
Think ahead, light me up&nbsp;
And rip my enemies apart&nbsp;

[137]
Sipping wine in Gethsemane, waiting on my enemies
I eat the pomegranate seeds but pay price like Persephone
You love me now but how long till you choose to crucify me
Those aren't hickeys, I get lapel choked by craft's reality

[NVRENDS]
Pass me the pen and a pad&nbsp;
I'll write again and again when you're mad
Flip up the switch and I'll change it right back
Back in my day I was more than just bad
I was worse than the devil on top of my back
Pick up the shovel now dig up the facts&nbsp;
Test me again and I'll push you right back
Down to your level I'll take out the trash&nbsp;

Throw away every hope and dream you have&nbsp;
Of me sinking down you're mad
Cuz you'll never see what I see
God damn be a man
You keep on wasting all my time
Creeping down my fucking spine
You hate your life because you can't have mine

[137]
Got no bench in marathon
I'm running like Iditarod
I'm searching for the seventh side
While looking at a pentagon
I see so many full of it
I'm handing out some enemas

The bigger the star, the shorter it burns
And I got a carbon core, so I can't be taciturn

I got no want for the hidden animosity
Shed blood for the sake of luminosity
Got a cornerman above with some bloody towels

Quite a thing to keep down in bowels
Fecund fields, plucked by crows
See procession of muddy cowls
Trudged right through where Charon rows

Want myself a Misa Misa
If I become Mansa Musa
Are those hooves or are they heels
One more snake, I could make Medusa

Have you seen the shadows outside of the limelight
Have you seen the lands that I traveled when I write
It's times like these in which I wouldn't mind to be tearful
They say my path is manifest but it's only patent in hindsight

[NVRENDS]
Hey
I see you looking at me
Now watch your step&nbsp;before you trip and fall right under my feet
Hey
What is it that you seek
Do you really want a piece of me six feet deep

Know the kinds of demons you will find

Forgiving, not indulgent
Tryna craft my verses so they're cogent
Thin lines between the aforementioned pairs;
I've seen how tension wears
Fields free from tares are my greatest cares

I've seen some better days
And I've known some better nights
Nonetheless, my ardor stays
Cedar to termites

I never really realized
I wasn't truly baptized
Till I was able to put my life upon a table
And watch the feeble cable upon which it all relies
And take my taste of vale's lies

I've sown some mighty seeds
And have flown amongst the crows;
I have seen how pencil bleeds
O'er Styx my pen rows

I
Have seen the Reaper
In
The eyes of man

Cold
Are jeers of critics;
Bold
I must stand

It feels off to take a girl out on my mother's money
So I do seek secure the bag
I'm not frontin' for honey

But I don't need dough for some idle beauty
Pen's all I need for my kind of duty
Scratch of the paper'll do it for me
If I bleed for the craft I can write a story

I don't want to spend my life beholden to the banal;
If you know me you know I see writing on the panel

Chosen
Easy to forget when you're surrounded;
Blinded
By the sickly seeds which Orchard's founded on;
I'm not a pawn
I am the board upon which the game is played upon

Fall to my knees;
I will sail how I know;
I hear call of the seas
Mast and canvas are my flow

Feeling like writing a villanelle and some quatrains;
Feeling sweetness like vanilla coursing through my veins;
Familiar sensation of the craft taking soul's reins;
Recognizing pitter-patter of creativity's rains

Chasing
Not for the cup of the liquor
But for my vocation;
Pacing
Not for the sake to be sicker
But for the pure reason of patience

Long into the night I work upon my craft;
I've been swimming in the sea
Without even inflated raft;
All that's certain in this life is uncertainty
While you're searching for surety
I'm in love with insanity

If you cry Ma
It won't buy time;
I've been walking in the tundra
In dead of night;
And I sing my songs
So I don't lose sight;
I know all the creatures
Are drawn to the light

Haven't found a lover on my lonely trail
'Cause my uncle always taught me chase more than tail;
I'm the kind of brother that'll seek life's wrath
For sake of blood to write a tale

Closing my eyelids I see my moira, yeah, see I my fate
Which is another reason nothing on this earth can hope me sate

Sweet
I look like cinnamon;
Sour
Tasting from my lemon pen;
Wheat
I separate it from the chaff;
Power as I use my staff

Swinging like a Tarzan
Through the jungle—Wisdom;
Spray can—I am—
Making art on the walls of the mausoleums
'Spite the spectators of the coliseums;
I know it appalls but I draw on the palls;
And I speed it up
And I do not pause;
I'm a shepherd to the flock and I see the paws
Of the wolf in the midst of the sheep—
Big jaws

If you cry Ma
It won't buy time;
I've been walking in the tundra
In dead of night;
And I sing my songs
So I don't lose sight;
I know all the creatures
Are drawn to the light

Smooth despite friction
Bathed in the lake of each sweet benediction
Keeping conviction in spite of confliction
And even my diction's survived liquidation
And even my flesh has survived the sensation
Of arid words and castigation
Of acrid thoughts and rumination;
I've learned to search for lumination
Midst the black and degradation
And if you want and explanation
Here is my delineation:
Every night I close my eyes
I lock my door—
Avoid surprise—
So I may wake to sun partake
And know my life shan't me forsake
I have:
A little more to bake
A little more to break
A little more air for my lungs to in take
A little more blood for the struggle's sake
I'll fight in the now and forget about the wake;
I've sight for the stars
Skin for the scars
Ink for the bars
Grins for the fight
Smiles for the blight
Vision for the night
And love for the right;

Ice to the cream, snow to the flake
Size to leviathan, fire to a drake
Runes innate like plates to a quake

Okay, never been shit, never had shit
Never knew shit, never out, never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist
Never had shit, I'ma take
Never askin', "Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything, nigga, give me everything, nigga…"
Again, never been shit, never had shit
Never knew shit, never out, never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a bezel on the wrist
Never had shit, never take
Never askin', "Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything, nigga, give me everything, nigga
Give me everything…"

[Verse 1]
Never had a real dollar to my name, bruh, shit been lame, bruh
I ain't even in this shit for the fame, bruh, it's the pain, bruh
Most of the niggas I came up with haven't came up
And doin' the same stuff, but I haven't came up, this really ain't none
Niggas thinkin' that they fuckin' with JID, y'all got the game fucked up
Tremendously, can't fuck with the mind of a mental fiend
Who dig deep in the depths when he in too deep
I crept on the steps where the demon sleeps
And yell, belch, tell my Lord what he means to me
"Oh, my God, don't be mean to me"
In the ride with a bean or three
And it's not what it seems to be, I can die, I can fly
I can try very easily, I'm a guy and a giant
She's a vivrant thing, I prolly won't buy it
Bird bitch, take flight, no pilot
Serve dick, curve bitch, no bias
Back up, back up, chick, bad timing
I got to get on stage, you better get on page
I have you looking out the windowpane
Or in the rain or anything but in a way
And if I say that's what it is, forget the lip
Now, what's my point, now I forget—damn, this bitch
Got me fuckin' up my script, fuck this shit, I got this shit
Gettin' to the point where everybody say they from the block and shit
With Glocks and shit and poppin', pimpin', trappin', sippin' lean
Y'all niggas fall for anything, you got the plug in Medellín?
Kingpin? You a pen king (Kingpin? You a pen king, ayy)
Bye, bye, niggas, 'N Sync, try I? Nigga, risky
Fire, fire from the wrist piece, niggas shootin' like the '60s

[Chorus]
Again, never been shit, never had shit, never knew shit
Never out, never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist
Never had shit, I'ma take
Never asking, "Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything, nigga, fuck you…"

Uhh, let's go

[Verse 2]
Yeah… yeah, yeah, what, um
Alright, what you call a chick that don't suck dick? You don't
And if you think you finna come up this, you won't
Down comes the boogie and up jumps the funk
This beat takin' a beating, I hand out the lumps
Damn, baby, yo' ass stand out in pumps
That's outstanding, stand outside until your man come
Or you can leave with the kid, we can plan some'
You know I came from the dirt like a sandstorm
Nigga, this a 3 point and-1
And 100, Wilt Chamberlain with the hand dunk
Shawty love JID, let me turn her to a hand puppet
She moan, sound like German or something
Run game, bitches think I'm Todd Gurley or something
Give me a jersey, I done balled so hard, I caught a hernia
Wheeled yo' bitch out my bed in a gurney
You gotta leave lil' mama, the clock's turning
I hit it first, Ray J or Ron Jeremy
They bleed like us so them niggas could never scare me
No niggas got more glow than JID, barely scratchin' the fucking surface
You need work, you need purpose
Everybody good, everybody trap perfect
Everything cool, don't nobody act nervous
Just ignore the fact that your favorite rap nigga is a sap nigga
We don't dap niggas, get the rrr-rat from the ratchet
Get the pack out the package
Lil' savage ass, ratchet ass, bastard ass, havin' ass
Rappin' ass, jackin' ass, wait
Finna blast, green dot, send the cash, pen and pad
Minivan, been a dad, been with that bullshit, nigga
I don't wake up to the bull like I usually do
Young niggas down the block on the woopty woop
Better pray to God they don't shoot at you
Dreams of cleanin' this dirty money out my cuticles
Then a nigga make the crowd jump like Zoboomafoo

Want to
Know what
I do
Write about
Each day
I suppose
I just
Describe
The creatures
In one's
Attic space

I don't got a favorite style
I do what the beat beckons;
Always been wary of smiles
Specially from Sirens;
I've been called bibliophile
(Seeing what page reckons);
At the feast of wisdom
Man, I go back for my seconds

All of the venom is not an anomaly
Know it's indicative of a disease;
I have been looking around for the comedy
Midst all the filth and the pestilent fleas

Oh my, had to scrape some people up from my floor
So I could deliver them back to their own door
Funny how good liquor can eliminate the senses
Couple downed shots and they're messing up decor;
And I got a message for the housing authorities
Your enforcement is so filled with big holes and deformities

I, keep the club bouncing like Tigger;
Fie, many don't keep the same vigor;
Sigh, little things can really get bigger
If you got a problem try to pull the fucking trigger

Listen, I don't want to have an attitude
So I'll try to say this without even being rude
I don't want to be that person rejoicing in ostracization
But won't you see the fucking enemies accrued

Please
I do not want your advice
I'm more obliged to throw my bloody dice
Than listen to someone who's not in the trenches
Please name me a coach who instructs from the benches

Said this before, happily, I'll say it again:
If you don't understand the truth coming out of my pen
Then I do suggest you put on your reading glasses
Wouldn't understand me if I fucking spoke molasses

Listen to me
That's not a strike to the ones who don't get it at first
It's a strike to the ones who drink the most and have the least of thirst
It's a reproach of the hungry roach that tries to spoil kitchen goods
It's a castigation of the wolves that roam within the woods

When I was younger, didn't have that many friends
And I pushed all through my hunger so I could—my field—till
Then I got older, and you know how the path bends
Well the only hunger I now have is for the fucking quill

I don't got a favorite style
I do what the beat beckons;
Always been wary of smiles
Specially from Sirens;
I've been called bibliophile
(Seeing what page reckons);
At the feast of wisdom
Man, I go back for my seconds

Gloom, when I came out the womb
But I made the best of my gilded tomb;
Doom, at the bottom of life's flume
Fee-fi-fo-fum, giants need room

Don't need a gold chain
Just want a bigger, bigger crowd
For the arcane runes that I been sprayin';
And yes I do want brain
But I'm talking 'bout the one in head
Not the one for which you're prayin'

I, keep the club bouncing like Tigger;
Fie, many don't keep the same vigor;
Sigh, little things can really get bigger
If you got a problem try to pull the fucking trigger

All the wayworn souls by that river won't forget me

Frozen
In the bitter blizzard that's called

Build a brazen movement
Then a kingdom

You lost reverence
Because of close proximity
Your residence
Is in the bowеls of normalcy
Sages eaten

Know I
Do keep a pеn in my vicinity
Able to knight a willing subject
Upon a bended knee

Don't vie
For my vantage point, unpreparedly
'Cause you might be harrowed
By the things your inner eyes will see

Pick a card
Wonder who you'll meet upon the boulevard
Of your dreams
Met the Reaper just the other day
The scenes with themes
Macabre
Are embedded in my very seams
Abracadabra
Create as I speak and I speak as it truly seems

Speak too much truth
Gotta lie low
Hard to spit a rhyme while in Hades with a halo

I feel craft is the lotion to dryness
When you next address me
You may utter words: Your Highness

Build a brazen movement

Nearly drowned but I'm okay
Went to Triton with a bouquet
Saw a bull and I said olé

Like I'm living in the Balkans
In 1914;
Give me protein
Give me something
I just need to keep my sugar up;
Adimpleate my cup
Observe the chalice from which I sup
All the malice with which I put up

Drink, drink, drink
From the sink, sink, sink's
What I do, get a clue
Let me explain it to you:
I, dip my two hands in the water
And bring them to mouth
Like a member of Gideon's army
So even if things were to go so far south
I just know all my senses are set to alarm me

Lots of people want to make a lasting matrimony
With their misery
They need advisory
They're the kind of ones to put their mouths to the river
Taking both eyes off the enemy

I'm a chosen one
Even whilst I'm drinking from the faucet, son;
I keep the rhymes spinning
Like a merry-go-round;
Man, I'm so in love with writing that I merge it with sound;
And
When I'm writin'
I just seem to see the storm encroachin'
Even whilst I'm in the fields sowin'
I'm still able to see blight approachin'

I keep myself calm
I'm a monk from Tibet;
And if you must drain me
Then try your pipet
I'm the ocean
You will get wet;
I'm an underdog
Make a good bet

Call me Galapagos, I am evolved;
See all the things in which I am involved;
Many a quandary conquered and solved;
Many a salt that I've gone and dissolved

Gotta give the credit to above;
Gotta give my love
To my kinfolk
All the same folk
Who did raise me when I was yolk
And I also thank my kith
Some were friendly
Some were surly
But I've always pushed on heartily
Like Odysseus in myth

Witness revolution like a Leonora Sansay;
I dispatch with opposition, you can call me sensei;
I dream all day
Then write all night
And, you will find, I bear such great respect for plight

People, all around, haven't earned my trust
Rather sit here and drown
Than give you my brush

Spend my days down low, low, low
And I won't give up
Either pen or flow

I walk all around
And see creatures crowned
And I feel the ground beneath
Shake as they're given wreath

Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub
Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

When I became the sun, I shone life into the man's hearts

I'ma turn your shit around wit' some friendly services

Cockroaches and the rat shit
Hand me downs with the patches
Mama put a little money in the mattress
Taught me how to make a silver spoon out of plastic
You can either sink, swim or be the captain
Get the last word I'mma get the last laugh in
Now they say "Jidenna why you dressing so classic?"
I don’t want my best dressed day in a casket
You can either lead, follow or get out the way
Make a fuckin' move it would make my fuckin' day
Got a 100 year plan you jus' think about today
Always been about time more than been about pay
Can't rump with me
Usain couldn’t run with me
Chief come to find you
You don’t come for me
At best you can run a lil' company
Nigga at worst, I could run the whole country
That's right - pimp game like a brothel&nbsp;
That's why - I don’t judge a nigga's hustle&nbsp;
I Airbnb the crib like a hostel&nbsp;
Summer rate cheaper 'cause the streets get hostile
Shaka boy, this fire from Mojave boy
So no I won’t record for your homie boy&nbsp;
I turn the party out like a naughty toy
Then I go and hide in plain sight like a lobby boy
Yessuh, that's Jidenna on the banner
Ridin' for my niggas gettin' locked up in the slammer
Elders saying everything's a nail to a hammer
And niggas can’t spell but we know our Instagrammar
Well done's better than well said
I read niggas well, a nigga well read
Really I ain't met nobody smarter
That's why I got admitted but I still rejected Harvard
I’m the fresh prince, in a school where they couldn’t read
Mama put me in a school with the Kennedys
When I met Bill Clinton I was seventeen
But dead presidents is all my niggas need
Dining with the governor's daughter
And her father say I remind him of Obama
I’m the chief diplomat...every day
And I’m black and white...Janelle Monae

Look, on everything
I gave everything and got nothing back
Ain't looking for no pat on backs
That ain't how we got where the fuck we at
Mama called, "Where the fuck you at?"
"On the road, and I ain't coming back
Until my hundred stacks make a hundred racks
And that hundred racks bring a bundle back"

Shit, shit ain't really working out, huh
Now I got a little bread, got my niggas working outta town
Baby, your ass fat, I can see you working out, shit
And you got a new job? Tell me, how that shit working out? Heh
Heard you doing pretty good, yeah, people talk, word of mouth
Wasn't 'round when you had the dirty house
Now they won't leave when you kick 'em out
These type of people can't stick around
Only down when there's liquor 'round or the spliff around
That's why I don't fuck with niggas now
Well, I fuck with all my niggas, you know the difference
You been living with tunnel vision
You and all of your friends are like wonder women
Wonder Woman working for it, if you ever wanted something
Searching for a purpose, I see what you on
The difference in how you be using your gifts
In the midst of the shit that you dealing with
Really specific, you paid attention, panoramic
You got the vision like a fer-de-lance
You attack and you kill it, sinkin' your teeth with the venom
Kinda like me with these instrumentals
Or the pen and the pencil or off the temple
Pimpin' since been pimpin', keep it sensible
Since you winning, you a object of ridicule
Objects appearing closer than you ready for
Obviously, you don't know what's ahead
But that's the reason you can work 'til you dead

[Chorus]
I been working hella hard, shit ain't really working out
I been praying to the Lord, shit ain't really working out
I been looking to the stars, keep my head up in the clouds
Shit ain't really working out, shit ain't really working out
Shit ain't really working out

Hello fiends, I brought novocaine plus dopamine
You can load your veins with the product I slang
Niggas gon' honor my name, boy, I'm a god in this game
Y'all niggas homonyms, sounding the same
Not in my lane so I can't complain
Me and Ben Frank got a damn good thing goin' on
Way more than a random fling
Cole and JID with a tandem, niggas can't stand 'em
Got a new anthem, look at my whip
Slit on my wrist, suicide, suicide doors on my Phantom

[Chorus: JID & J. Cole]
Get off my dick, get off my dick
.40 my hip, loadin' my clip
Cannabis, cannabis, rollin' my spliff
Hannibal, Hannibal, look what I did
Edible, edible, got the munchies
But I got the bungees, I'ma jump off this shit
But I bet he get whipped with the pistol grip
Nigga talkin' that shit, now I'm talkin' my shit

[Outro: JID, DJ Drama & Valee]
Get off my dick (Yeah)
Get off my dick (Whoa)
Get off my dick (Yeah)
Get off my dick (Whoa)
Get off my dick (Yeah)
Get off my dick (Yeah)
Get off my dick (Yeah)
Get off my dick (Yeah)

Get off my dick (Get off my)
Get off my dick (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Reese LAFLARE]
I got big dreams so my watch got a big face (Big dreams)
Girls gettin' mixy like a motherfuckin' mixtape (I'm tellin' ya)
Smellin' like money and I'm lookin' like sex (Big racks)

Nigga ride wave, then the nigga get taxed (Hey)

They all ball cap, and this all facts (Big facts)
No, I don't relax and I don't lack

[Verse 2: Bas & Guapdad 4000]
Demons, they follow me deep in the dark
Niggas got problems with being a boss
We ain't been home but we hear all the talkin'
Hit 'em with hollows and clean 'em with salt
Salt in the wound and my heart in the cooler
Frozen like I gave my heart to my jeweler
Told him to make a new piece out of this
Ever since, I just can't give no fuck 'bout no bitch (It's a check)

[Chorus: Guapdad 4000]
Baby (Yeah), had to bustdown on the AP (AP), yeah

Norman Bates with the eights, I'ma go psycho
Laundromat with a temper, this a vicious cycle
Feel like Rihanna, bitches go wherever I go
Go against the grain like I'm battlin' the silo
I'm going out west like I'm motherfuckin' Fievel
LeBron in the finals, motherfuckin' five-oh
Nigga bettin' under 5'4", hell if I know

[Verse 4: Mez & Guapdad 4000]
Niggas got me tight like Arthur's fist and shit
Like I'm not an arsonist and shit
Not a nigga that you wanna argue with
'Cause then you fucking with your future like Larsa Pippen, shit
Boy, I'm like a barber with this shit
You get out the chair, you get in the chair
The things in the mirror, the way they appear
You look to the rear, my niggas is near, my niggas revered
You fuckin' with Mez, you fuckin' with Heirs, nigga (It's a check)

Diamonds on me water like a faucet (Yeah, flash)
Got a lot of bands in Costa Rica
Lot of hoes in Costa Rica (Uh), got a passport in my pocket (Yeah)
And I flew with the stick, it's a rocket (Uh)
Forty-five on me, shit hot like a pocket (Doo-doo)
You ain't talkin' money, it's nonsense (Yeah)
Got your baby mama doing drugs in the moshpit

Top of the morning to anybody who thought it was beddy-bye
Jiddy, I'm like a Jedi
Mind tricks live inside of your head, I
Devilish, red eyes, never been on a redeye
Or shit, I be high, I forget
Shawty said I be wildin' and trippin' when I'm on a lick
Score a penny or twenty, I'm Dominique Wilkins and shit
Really I flew to Costa Rica with an AP
At the airport, this girl ask me, "Hey, are you Swae Lee?”
Wow (It's a check)

Suffering succotash
She think it's all puddycat but, hell, I ain't even mad
I started sucking on her titty, put my thumb in her ass
She had a little one, it really wasn't nothin' to grab, I did it anyway
Nigga, I'm a bag
Comin' down the 91, flyin', doin' the dash

And I been writing my ass off, Ernest Hemingway (Bitch)

Yeah, run, Ricky, run, run nigga, run, jump, nigga, jump
Come here they come, run, run, run, run
Gun with the drum, bum bitty bum, slump in the trunk
My city go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
151 rum and a blunt
Young nigga numb, numb, numb and he got a little gun
A little bitty killer really doin' it for fun
Give him a little bit and he'll get a nigga done

[Verse]
Son of a god, son of a bitch
Son of woman and man, son of a son, in a sunken abyss
Summon a plan, please come with a script
Cover my back, cover man, please come with the blitz
Look at the stats, JID like a magician
Fuck that, this some real ass shit, I paid blood for this
Taking cheese from the government
Cereal boxes with the bugs in it
Hand me down, this my brother brother's shit
Don't compare me to no other other niggas
In the city, boy, they say they fucking with you
Heebie jeebie, that's a bit disgusting, but I get it
I'm full of tension, full of spirit but full of shit
Standing next to Lil Tay when that bullet hit him
Shit, I miss him, I wish that that bullet missed him but it didn't
And since I been living with it like a sickness
Intimate, infinite rhymes, give me the baton
A ticking, ticking time bomb, takin' the finish line
Look alive, look in my eyes, look at you niggas tryin'
And ya dumb, dumb, better run, run 'cause we fryin' em
Eastside, where ya from, from niggas wildin'
So be silent before my niggas creep silent
With street knowledge, complete nonsense
Delete comments, online, all lies, we see violence
Every day in my eyes, they killing my niggas, die, nigga die
Pull up with the fye, get 'em, nigga, it's eye for an eye
If we gotta ride, fuck it, nigga, ride for the ride of ya life
Diabolical minds, I don't mind it, I like it, I like it, I love it
I fuck with you, you a thug, I'ma thug with you
We can knuck, we can buck if a nigga fuck with you
I got love for you out the mud with you, off the muscle

[Chorus]
Yeah, run Ricky, run, run nigga, run, jump nigga, jump
Come here they come run, run, run, run
Gun with the drum, bum bitty bum, slump in the trunk
My city go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
151 rum and a blunt
Young nigga numb, numb, numb and he got a little gun
A little bitty killer really doin' it for fun

My dear I want you here (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
But don't get too near for there’s lions beware (Ahh Bam-Bambi)

[Verse 1]
Oh Bambi I won't lie
If I weren't in this spider web of mine
If grandfather never had seven wives
Then darling you would be love of my life
Oh Bambi it's my design
To run the jungle I must be a lion
Or be a cheetah but neither is fine
Don't wanna hurt my dear love of my life

Bambi Bambi (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
My dear, my dear, my dear (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
My dear I want you here (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
But don't get too near for there’s lions beware (Ahh Bam-Bambi)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I hide
When you FaceTime I text you back a lie
‘Cause I'm afraid to look back in your eyes
I'm terrified you were love of my life
The women among the tribe
They will be jealous of this lullaby
I'll drink alone in my hotel and cry
‘Cause now they know you are love of my life

Bambi Bambi (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
My dear, my dear, my dear (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
My dear I want you here (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
But don't get too near for there’s lions beware (Ahh Bam-Bambi)

I wish that we were forever young
I always knew that this day would come
The fork in the road where I cannot run
Between loving many and loving one
I got the wedding invitation Bambi
I'm happy that he wants to make a family
But I cannot promise I won’t run up in the church there screamin’ your name Bambi
No one can take you from me Bambi
No one can take you from me Bambi
No one can take you from me Bambi

Bambi Bambi (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
My dear, my dear, my dear (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
My dear I want you here (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
